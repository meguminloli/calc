# calc

A CLI calculator written in Rust

It can be used as a library.
For now, it uses `Decimal` from rust_decimal because it has better precision than the default `f64`.

The CLI supports
- Value binding
- Calculus
- Inbuilt functions like `list`, `exit`
- Inbuilt functions for the library like `sin`, `cos`, `max`

### TODO:

- [] Add function binding
- [] Write a GUI for it
- [] Add more inbuilt functions to the CLI
- [] Better parsing
